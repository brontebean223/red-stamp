# Bronte Bean | Red Stamp Technical Exam | October 11th 2017

Hello! Here is my technical exam for Red Stamp. 

A few notes:
- Foundation 6 was used as Framework
- Stylesheets have been coded & complied with SASS
- All images & fonts provided are within the project folder
- Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to a device with IE so I was not able to 'fully' cross browser test. My apologies. 

If you have any questions or would like to see any additional work/code please let me know. Thanks!
